# snake-client
Designed to teach about networking whilst giving us the opportunity to review and use callbacks, asynchronous control flow, modules in node, writing modular code, refactoring code, working with stdin. Through the context of building out a part of a game that runs in the terminal, we will learn how to connect a client to a server using TCP.
